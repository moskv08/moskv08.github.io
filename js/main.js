    Has access to the DOM and contains the SceneManager.

    1.  Create the SceneManager, while passing a canvas to it 
        (so that SceneManager wonâ€™t have to meddle with the DOM).
    2.  Attach listeners to the DOM events we care about (such as windowresize or mousemove).
    3.  Start the render loop, by calling requestAnimationFrame().
